The stockmonkey distribution is supposed to contain all the technical analysis
tools you'd ever want.  It has a few things, but it's sadly lacking.

Here's the tiny catalog so far:

Math::Business::SMA                     Simple Moving Average
Math::Business::EMA                     Exponential Moving Average
Math::Business::WMA                     Weighted Moving Average
Math::Business::HMA                     Hull Moving Average
Math::Business::LaguerreFilter          Laguerre Filter (DSP technique)
Math::Business::MACD                    Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
Math::Business::RSI                     Relative Strength Index
Math::Business::BollingerBands          Bollinger Bands
Math::Business::ATR                     Average True Value
Math::Business::DMI                     Directional Movement Index (aka ADX)
Math::Business::ParabolicSAR            Parabolic Stop and Reversal

If you'd like to help, or even just *suggest* a module, just let me know.

Links to the algorithm are helpful as our spreadsheets with example
calculations, but they are not necessary.

I do check rt.cpan.org, so that's definitely one way to go.
