The stockmonkey distribution is supposed to contain all the technical analysis
tools you'd ever want.  It has a few things, but it's sadly lacking.

Here's the tiny catalog so far:

Math::Business::SMA             Simple Moving Average
Math::Business::EMA             Exponential Moving Average
Math::Business::MACD            Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
Math::Business::RSI             Relative Strength Index
Math::Business::BollingerBands  Bollinger Bands
Math::Business::ATR             Average True Value
Math::Business::DMI             Directional Movement Index (aka ADX)

If you'd like to help, or even just *suggest* a module, just let me know.

Links to the algorithm are helpful as our spreadsheets with example
calculations, but they are not necessary.
