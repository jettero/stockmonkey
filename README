The stockmonkey distribution is supposed to contain all the
technical analysis tools you'd ever want.  It has a few things,
but it's sadly lacking.

If you'd like to help, just let me know.

Links to the algorithm are helpful as our spreadsheets with
example calculations.

Here's the tiny catalog so far:

Math::Business::SMA             Simple Moving Average
Math::Business::EMA             Exponential Moving Average
Math::Business::MACD            Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
Math::Business::RSI             Relative Strength Index
Math::Business::BollingerBands  Bollinger Bands
