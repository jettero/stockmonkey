=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Business::ATR;

  my $atr = new Math::Business::ATR;
     $atr->set_days(14);

  # alternatively/equivilently
  my $atr = new Math::Business::ATR(14);

      [ 6, 4, 5 ],
      [ 5, 4, 4.5 ],
  );

  # choose one:

=head1 RESEARCHER

The ATR was designed by J. Welles Wilder Jr circa 1978.

The ATR is meant to be a measure of the volatility of the stock price.  It
does not provide any indication of the direction of the moves, only how
erratic the moves may be.

Wilder felt that large ranges meant traders are willing to I<continue>
bidding up (or selling down) a stock.
