=head1 NAME

Math::Business::CCI - Technical Analysis: Commodity Channel Index

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Business::CCI;

  my $rsi = new Math::Business::CCI;
     $rsi->set_scale(0.015); # Lambert used 0.015, which is default
     $rsi->set_days(20);     # defaults to 20, no recommendation

=head1 RESEARCHER

The CCI was designed by Donald Lambert circa 1980.

The index is meant to indicate oversold and overbought status.  Numbers over
100 are called “overbought” and numbers under -100 are called “oversold.”
Longer periods will result in less spikes above and below these thresholds.
