=head1 NAME

Math::Business::HMA - Technical Analysis: Hull Moving Average

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Business::HMA;

  my $avg = new Math::Business::HMA;
     $avg->set_days(8);

  my @closing_values = qw(
      3 4 4 5 6 5 6 5 5 5 5
      6 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 8
  );

  # choose one:
  $avg->insert( @closing_values );
  $avg->insert( $_ ) for @closing_values;

  if( defined(my $q = $avg->query) ) {
      print "value: $q.\n";

  } else {
      print "value: n/a.\n";
  }

For short, you can skip the set_days() by suppling the setting to new():

  my $longer_avg = new Math::Business::HMA(10);

=head1 RESEARCHER

The Hull Moving Average was invented Alan Hull circa 1990[?].

An SMA can smooth data fairly well but tends to lag terribly.  The HMA tries to
smooth data quickly (without the lag) by averaging some weighted moving
averages (L<Math::Business::WMA>) of itself at various intervals.
