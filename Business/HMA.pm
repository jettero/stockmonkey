    # The HMA manages to keep up with rapid changes in price activity whilst
    # having superior smoothing over an SMA of the same period. The HMA employs
    # weighted moving averages and dampens the smoothing effect (and resulting
    # lag) by using the square root of the period instead of the actual period
    # itselfâ€¦as seen below.

    # Integer (Square Root (Period)) WMA [2 x Integer (Period/2) WMA (Price) -
    # Period WMA (Price)]

    # The following formulas for the Hull Moving Average are for MetaStock and
    # Supercharts but can be easily adapted for use with other charting
    # programs that are capable of custom indicator construction.

    # MetaStock Formula
    # period:=Input("period",1,200,20);sqrtperiod:=Sqrt(period);Mov(2*Mov(C,period/2,W)
    # - Mov(C,period,W),LastValue(sqrtperiod),W);

    # SuperCharts Formula
    # Input: period (Default value 20) waverage (2*waverage
    # (close,period/2)-waverage (close,period), SquareRoot (Period))

    # A simple application for the HMA, given its superior smoothing, would be
    # to employ the turning points as entry/exit signals. However it shouldn't
    # be used to generate crossover signals as this technique relies on lag.

=head1 NAME

Math::Business::HMA - Technical Analysis: Hull Moving Average

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Business::HMA;

  my $avg = new Math::Business::HMA;
     $avg->set_days(8);

  my @closing_values = qw(
      3 4 4 5 6 5 6 5 5 5 5 
      6 6 6 6 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 
  );

  # choose one:
  $avg->insert( @closing_values );
  $avg->insert( $_ ) for @closing_values;

  if( defined(my $q = $avg->query) ) {
      print "value: $q.\n";  

  } else {
      print "value: n/a.\n";
  }

To avoid recalculating huge lists when you add a few new values on the end;

  $avg->start_with( $the_last_calculated_value );

For short, you can skip the set_days() by suppling the setting to new():

  my $longer_avg = new Math::Business::HMA(10);
