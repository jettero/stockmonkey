Math::Business::Stochastic - Technical Analysis: Stochastic Oscillator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Business::Stochastic;

  my $sto = new Math::Business::Stochastic;
     $sto->set_days(5);     # Lane uses 5 in his examples (if any)
     $sto->set_dperiod(30); # Lane
     $sto->set_method( Math::Business::Stochastic::METHOD_LANE );


  # Lane's version
  my $sto = Math::Business::Stochastic->recommended;


  # Probably more like what you expect (ie, matches up with
  # Yahoo/Google/Ameritrade, etc)

  my $sto_slow = Math::Business::Stochastic->modern_slow;
  my $sto_fast = Math::Business::Stochastic->modern_fast;
  my $sto_full = Math::Business::Stochastic->modern_full;


  # basic usage

  $sto->insert($close);
  my ($K, $D) = $sto->query;
  print "current stochastic: %K=$K and %D=$D\n";

=head1 RESEARCHER

The Stochastic was designed by R. George C. Lane.

It is difficult to find a good reference on this indicator.  Almost every
source disagrees with the next and some sources even disagree internally
(I'm looking at you Wikipedia).

The stochastic (among other things) purports to indicate an "overbought"
situation where the C<%K> is above 80 and "oversold" when below 20.

There are "divergences" and "convergences" to look for too, however.  If
there is a higher high or a lower low in the C<%K>, this can apperntly
indicate trend changes.  This concept is not easy to pin down explicitly,
and so is not described here.

=head1 FUTHER BACKGROUND ON COMPUTATION

The basic idea is that C<%K> should be a momentum indicator and C<%D>
should be a smoothed version of C<%K>.  Most sources generally agree that
C<%K(5)> should be computed as follows:

  $K = 100 * (close - min(@last_5_low))/(max(@last_5_high)-min(@last_5_low))

C<%D> is more sticky and various sources give various answers.   Lane
himself seemed to use:

  $D = 100 * max(@last_3_high)/min(@last_3_low)

But most charting sites and the Wikipedia seem to choose an SMA or EMA for
smothing on C<%D> and thus produce something like:

  $SMA->set_days(3);
  $SMA->insert($K);
  $D = $SMA->query;

The main problem getting this right is that Lane himself hasn't really
spelled it out in publication.  "Do this, then this, then that."  The
reason seems to be the lecture circuit.  He teaches this stuff in classes
and seminars (or tought) and hasn't really published it in the traditional
sense.

To a certain extent, we therefore feel free to pick whatever we want for
the defaults.
