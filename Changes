2.11: Sun Jul 13 13:08:22 EDT 2008
    - fixed the HMA test.  HMA can apparently exceed (or
      under-ceed) input-min-max boundaries.  Huh.

2.10: Sat Jul 12 20:33:50 EDT 2008
    - Gustav <gustavf@gmail.com> found that ParabolicSAR fails to
      accept four tuples that That must have been hard to figure out...
    - I also apparently misspelled tuple everywhere, wow
    - I added a FAQ pointing to Genius Trader

2.9: Wed Jul  2 15:44:30 EDT 2008
    - Added LaguerreFilter (a fascinating take on moving averages
      using digital filter processing)
    - added a test for the LF
    - switched the adaptive diff filter from an average to a
      median (more literally what's in Ehlers' book)

2.8: Sun Jun 30 19:55:50 EDT 2008
    - I axed the start_with functions... Storable's
      freeze()/thaw() should work better anyway.  Choose that.
    - gave instructions on using the dumpers and storable to
      avoid recalcs
    - Added WMA
    - Added the HMA (suggested by John Baker). I'm
      intrigued by it's purported low-lag smoothing abilities..

2.7: Fri Jun 20 16:41:36 EDT 2008
    - my doc rearrange didn't help...  I added NAME sections.
      Might work.

2.7: Thu Jun 19 06:24:27 EDT 2008
    - rearranged the distribution a little... the ::cookbook and
      ::faq pods weren't indexing right on search.cpan.org
    - perl5.6.x needs constant 1.05 (or at least greater than
      1.02) so I can use that nice constant { NAME => 1 } block.

2.6: Wed Jun 18 18:48:20 EDT 2008
    - finished the Parabolic SAR

2.6: Tue Jun 17 07:30:57 EDT 2008
    - skeled a ParabolicSAR module

2.5: Mon Jun 16 19:38:44 EDT 2008
    - screwed up the fix by not realizing that do{} evaluates to
      a scalar in 5.6 (wow).  So my 363 element list was setting
      my @close = do "file"; like it was @close=(363).
      Nice.  Oh well, 5.6 is ancient history.

2.4: Sun Jun 15 22:04:12 EDT 2008
    - fixed a do {} useless context "bug" so the amit test will
      pass on perl 5.6
    - I have been version-ing each module up each time I change
      the dist version, but I'm going to stop doing that now.

2.3: Sun Jun 15 19:01:53 EDT 2008
    - Doc bug...  Forgot to add
      set_alpha(14) = set_days(27)

2.2: Sat Jun 14 20:22:05 EDT 2008
    - RSI(14) really means EMA[27]/EMA[27]
      (indirectly suggested by Amit Dutt)

2.1: Mon Jun  9 13:39:44 EDT 2008
    - responding to a bug report from Greg Jessup
      ... seems the example in the MACD module is frelled in
      various ways.   Fixed.
    - improved the t/03_macd test
    - lost the use version since I'm using a floating point
      version

2.0: Wed Jun  4 19:19:33 EDT 2008
    - added a wantarray return to MACD query
    - fixed minor return() bug in MACD (boolean $m verses boolean
      defined($m))
    - minor doc-fix for RSI
    - unified versions

1.4: Mon Jun  2 06:52:18 EDT 2008
    - more documentation: what are these for?
    - finished the DMI start_with() function

1.4: Sun Jun  1 18:21:49 EDT 2008
    - fixed an irritating pseudo-bug in the ADX logic.
    - fixed a divide by zero bug in ADX... grrz.

1.3: Sat May 31 18:43:46 EDT 2008
    - doc bugs in the Bollinger Bands
    - added $class->recommended instantiaters.
    - sqrt(-2.07093e-20) in Bollinger Bands
    - ATR added
    - DMI added

1.2: Wed May 28 16:13:43 EDT 2008
    - version hell still

1.1: Wed May 28 15:29:56 EDT 2008
    - Yeah, my versions were too low on two modules.  Wow.

1.0: Wed May 28 07:36:23 EDT 2008
    - I combined all the Math::Business::* modules I wrote into
      one distribution
    - I made EMA faster and "better" and fixed the while(insert)
      where insert is 0
    - Refactored SMA to be smarter for long DBI calculations and
      possibly less smart for huge multi scalar inserts
    - Authored the RSI module to my tastes
    - Authored the Bollinger Bands module
