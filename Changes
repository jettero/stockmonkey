    - Yeah, my versions were too low on two modules.  Wow.

    - I combined all the Math::Business::* modules I wrote into
      one distribution
    - I made EMA faster and "better" and fixed the while(insert)
      where insert is 0
    - Refactored SMA to be smarter for long DBI calculations and
      possibly less smart for huge multi scalar inserts
    - Authored the RSI module to my tastes
    - Authored the Bollinger Bands module
