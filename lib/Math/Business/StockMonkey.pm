L<Math::Business::WMA> - Weighted Moving Average

L<Math::Business::HMA> - Hull Moving Average

L<Math::Business::LaguerreFilter> - Laguerre Filter (DSP technique)

L<Math::Business::MACD> - Moving Average Convergence/Divergence

L<Math::Business::RSI> - Relative Strength Index

L<Math::Business::BollingerBands> - Bollinger Bands

L<Math::Business::ATR> - Average True Value

L<Math::Business::DMI> - Directional Movement Index (aka ADX)

L<Math::Business::ADX> - Alias for DMI

L<Math::Business::ParabolicSAR> - Parabolic Stop and Reversal

L<Math::Business::CCI> - Commodity Channel Index

L<Math::Business::ConnorRSI> - Connor's 3 tuple average RSI with PriceRank

L<Math::Business::SM::Stochastic> -Stochastic Oscillator

If you'd like to help, or even just I<suggest> a module, just let me know.

Links to the algorithm are helpful as our spreadsheets with example
calculations, but they are not necessary.

I do check rt.cpan.org, so that's definitely one way to go.
