Math::Business::StockMonkey - Base documentation for the StockMonkey Collection

=head1 README

The stockmonkey distribution is supposed to contain all the technical analysis
tools you'd ever want.  It has a few things, but it's sadly lacking.

Here's the tiny catalog so far:

L<Math::Business::SMA> - Simple Moving Average

L<Math::Business::EMA> - Exponential Moving Average

L<Math::Business::WMA> - Weighted Moving Average

L<Math::Business::HMA> - Hull Moving Average

L<Math::Business::LaguerreFilter> - Laguerre Filter (DSP technique)

L<Math::Business::MACD> - Moving Average Convergence/Divergence

L<Math::Business::RSI> - Relative Strength Index

L<Math::Business::BollingerBands> - Bollinger Bands

L<Math::Business::ATR> - Average True Value

L<Math::Business::DMI> - Directional Movement Index (aka ADX)

L<Math::Business::ParabolicSAR> - Parabolic Stop and Reversal

=head1 CONTACT

If you'd like to help, or even just I<suggest> a module, just let me know.

Links to the algorithm are helpful as our spreadsheets with example
calculations, but they are not necessary.

I do check rt.cpan.org, so that's definitely one way to go.

I am using this software in my own projects...  If you find bugs, please please
please let me know.

I normally hang out on #perl on freenode, so you can try to get immediate
gratification there if you like.  L<irc://irc.freenode.net/perl>

There is also a mailing list with very light traffic that you might want to
join: L<http://groups.google.com/group/stockmonkey/>.
